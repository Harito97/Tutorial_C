# Intro about C++

## What

## Why

* **Support for low-level and high-level programming**

C++ allows you to write both low-level code, like memory manipulation, as well as high-level abstractions, like creating classes and using the Standard Template Library (STL).

See more in: `g++ Ex/Ex_low_level_and_high_level_program.cpp -o temp`

Note that g++ usually uses for .cpp file while gcc uses for .c file.

* **Extensive Libraries**

C++ offers a vast range of libraries and tools, such as the Standard Template Library (STL), Boost, and Qt, among others, that can aid in the development of your projects and make it more efficient.

## Compare C and C++

### Syntax and Semantics

* C: procedural programming language, functions and structured programming, memory management is manual.
* C++: procedural and object-oriented, functions and classes, memory management (manual or automatic).

### Module & Reuse code

* C: reuse code with module & function with included through headers.
* C++: reuse code plus with classes, inheritance, and polymorphism through namespace & OOP design.

### Error Handling

* C: return a value eg: 0 for susses and ...
* C++: more tool like `try`, `cat`, `throw` $\to$ more control over error handling.
